# 🏘️ Housing Affordability Visualizer 🏘️

This tool compares policy-driven differences in total development cost (TDC) for a single housing unit type and bedroom count against AMI-based affordability thresholds across Vermont regions. 

It is designed to help visualize how **changes in policy directly impact housing affordability**.

## User Inputs
- Housing product type: Townhome, Condo, Apartment  
- Number of bedrooms: *(for Townhome and Condo only — Apartments use a different model coming soon)*  
- Number of units to compare: (1–5)  
- For each unit:
  - Energy code standard  
  - Energy source  
  - Infrastructure requirement  
  - Finish quality  
- Vermont region(s): Chittenden, Addison, Rest of Vermont  
- AMI level(s): Choose up to 3

---

## What It Does
- Calculates TDC for each unit based on baseline costs and selected policy options  
- Retrieves affordable purchase price thresholds using AMI data for the selected regions  
- Generates a side‑by‑side visual comparison of costs vs. affordability  
- Auto‑labels baseline scenarios as `Baseline {Unit Type}` when default assumptions are met

---

## Output
- Bars = Total development cost for each scenario  
- Dashed lines = Affordability thresholds for selected AMI levels and regions  
- Dual Y‑axis: Left = TDC, Right = Affordability thresholds
