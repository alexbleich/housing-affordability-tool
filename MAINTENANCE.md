# üõ†Ô∏è Housing Affordability Tool ‚Äî Maintenance Guide

This guide is for people who are **not programmers** but want to make small changes to the Housing Affordability Visualizer.  
The app runs on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and updates automatically when changes are made in GitHub.

---

## How the Tool Works
- **Code:** The main logic is in `housing-affordability-tool.py`.  
- **Assumptions:** Policy costs are stored in `data/assumptions.csv`.  
- **Affordability thresholds:** Income & purchase price tables are in `data/chittenden_ami.csv`, `data/addison_ami.csv`, and `data/vermont_ami.csv`.  
- **Streamlit Cloud:** The app is redeployed automatically when you save changes on GitHub.

## The Easiest Way to Make Changes
1. Open the file on GitHub.  
2. Click the ‚úèÔ∏è **pencil icon** to edit.  
3. Change what you need to.
4. Scroll down, add a short commit message (like ‚Äúupdated finish quality costs‚Äù), and press **Commit changes**.
5. Refresh the Streamlit app to see your change.

## What You Can Safely Change
- **Numbers in CSV files:**  
  - Example: Change the cost per square foot of an energy source in `assumptions.csv`.  
  - Example: Update income levels in the AMI CSVs when new VHFA data is released.  
- **Labels in the Python file:**  
  - Search for the text you want to change (e.g., ‚ÄúKeep trying‚Äù message).  
- **Packages:** The top of the Python file has a section called `PKG`. You can rename or add new ‚Äúpackages‚Äù (Baseline, Top-of-the-Line, Below Baseline).

## Using ChatGPT to Help
If you need to change the Python file:
1. Copy the part of the code you want to change (you can copy the whole script if you'd like).  
2. Paste it into ChatGPT and ask a clear question or tell it specifically what you want.
   - Example: ‚ÄúHow do I add a new finish quality option called ‚ÄòLuxury‚Äô with a 20% adder?‚Äù  
   - Example: ‚ÄúI need the error message to display something different. Change it.‚Äù  
3. If you see an error in the Streamlit app, copy the error message and paste it into ChatGPT. It will fix it for you.

## Safety Tips
- **Make small edits.** If something breaks, it‚Äôs easier to undo.  
- **Use commit messages** like ‚Äúupdate AMI data‚Äù so you know what was changed.  
- **Don‚Äôt delete big sections** unless you are sure what they do.  
- **Remember:** GitHub saves all past versions. You can always roll back if need be, and the commit messages help you find where you want to get back to.

## When to Ask for Help
- If you want to add **new inputs** (e.g., a new policy option) or **change how the math works**, copy the relevant code section into ChatGPT and describe what you want.  
- If you only need to **update numbers** (e.g., assumptions, AMI tables), edit the CSVs directly within the `data` folder.
